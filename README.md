# Technical analysis quotex candlestick pattern

Candlestick charts have been used for over 100 years, originating in
18th century Japanese rice trading. The earliest known use was by famed
Japanese rice trader Munehisa Homma in the 1700s. They were later
brought to the Western world in the early 20th century by Japanese
chartist Sokyu Honma.
